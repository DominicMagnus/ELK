wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch

#check
file GPG-KEY-elasticsearch

# gpg supports several key formats, so if your key is in a different format, convert it by importing it into a temp keyring, then exporting it again:
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring ./temp-keyring.gpg --import GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring ./temp-keyring.gpg --export --output GPG-KEY-elasticsearch.gpg
rm temp-keyring.gpg

# copy keyring to /usr/share/keyrings/
sudo cp GPG-KEY-elasticsearch.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/

# At this point, nothing has changed and apt doesn't know the key exists. The last step is to modify the specific .list file for the repository to tell apt where to find the key for that specific repo.
# add gpg key to keyring store:
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list

# version tested 8.14.1

sudo apt install elasticsearch




sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN | grep 9200
